## Getting Started ✈️

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub Actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). You'll need to provide the action with a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** scoped to `read:user` and `read:org`, and the file to parse.

> **Note**
> This action only applies the template within the workspace. You will need to combine it with a deployment action in order to commit it to your project. You can see a full example of this below.

```yml
name: Generate Sponsors README
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 🛎️
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate Sponsors 💖
        uses: JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          file: 'README.md'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages 🚀
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: main
          folder: '.'
```

You'll also need to the following `<!-- sponsors --><!-- sponsors -->` in your `.md` file so the action knows where to place the data.

```md
# Awesome Project

Go you!

## Sponsors

These are our really cool sponsors!

<!-- sponsors --><!-- sponsors -->
```

#### Install as a Node Module 📦

If you'd like to use the functionality provided by this action in your own action you can either [create a composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action), or you can install it using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) by running the following commands. It's available on both the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jamesives/github-sponsors-readme-action) and [GitHub registry](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action/packages/229982).

```
yarn add @jamesives/github-sponsors-readme-action
```

```
npm install @jamesives/github-sponsors-readme-action
```

It can then be imported into your project like so.

```javascript
import run from '@jamesives/github-sponsors-readme-action'

run(configuration)
```

Calling the functions directly will require you to pass in an object containing the variables found in the [configuration section](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action#configuration-).

## Configuration 📁

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repository's `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).

#### Required Setup

The following options must be configured.

| Key     | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type   | Required |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `token` | You must provide the action with a Personal Access Token (PAT) with either the `user:read` or `org:read` permission scope and store it in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. This should be generated from the account or organization that receives sponsorship, and depending on your use case you may need to provide additional scopes. [Learn more about creating and using encrypted secrets here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). | `with` | **Yes**  |
| `file`  | This should point to the file that you're generating, for example `README.md` or `path/to/CREDITS.md`. Defaults to `README.md` if no value is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `with` | **Yes**  |

#### Optional Choices

| Key            | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Type   | Required |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `organization` | If you're displaying sponsorship information as or for an organization you should toggle this option to `true`. You also need to provide the action with an `org:read` and `user:read` scoped PAT.                                                    | `with` | **No**   |
| `minimum`      | Using this input you can set the minimum sponsorship threshold. For example setting this to `500` will only display sponsors who give of `$5 USD` and more. By default the action will display all of your sponsors.                                  | `with` | **No**   |
| `maximum`      | Using this input you can set the maximum sponsorship threshold. For example setting this to `500` will only display sponsors who give of `$5 USD` and less. By default the action will display all of your sponsors.                                  | `with` | **No**   |
| `marker`       | This allows you to modify the marker comment that is placed in your file. By default this is set to sponsors - `<!-- sponsors --> <!-- sponsors -->`, if you set this to `gold` for example you can place `<!-- gold --> <!-- gold -->` in your file. | `with` | **No**   |
| `fallback`     | Allows you to specify a fallback if you have no sponsors. By default nothing is displayed.                                                                                                                                                            | `with` | **No**   |
| `template`     | Allows you to modify the default template. Please refer to the `template` section of this README for more information.                                                                                                                                | `with` | **No**   |

#### Deployment Status

The action will export a step output as `sponsorship-status` that you can use in your workflow to determine if the task was successful or not. You can find an explanation of each status type below.

| Status    | Description                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success` | The `success` status indicates that the action was able to successfully generate the README.            |
| `failed`  | The `failed` status indicates that the action encountered an error while trying to generate the README. |
| `skipped` | The `skipped` status indicates that the action could not locate the markers in your .md file.           |
| `running` | The `running` status indicates that the action is actively working.                                     |

### Modifying the Template 🔧

You can modify the template that gets generated in your file by using the `template` input. This input allows you to leverage mustache templating to modify what is displayed. The following values are available.

| Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | The users full name. This can sometimes be `null` if the user hasn't set one. This can be accessed using `{{{ name }}}`                                                    |
| `login`      | The users login, this can be accessed using `{{{ login }}}`                                                                                                                |
| `url`        | The users GitHub profile url, this can be accessed using `{{{ url }}}`.                                                                                                    |
| `websiteUrl` | The users website url. This can sometimes be `null` if the user hasn't set one, if so this field will fall back to `url`. This can be accessed using `{{{ websiteUrl }}}`. |

You're able to use markdown or GitHub approved basic HTML. The default template can be found [here](./src/constants.ts#L28).

### Separating by Sponsorship Tier ✨

If you'd like to highlight certain users who contribute to a specific sponsorship tier you can do so using a combination of the `minimum`, `maximum` and `marker` inputs. The `minimum / maximum` inputs equal their dollar contribution in cents.
